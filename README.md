Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Description
This repository contains a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game created as part of a front-end coding assignment for the Promineo Tech Bootcamp. The game is designed with modern web technologies and follows the classic rules of Tic-Tac-Toe, with an aim to provide a smooth user experience and an attractive interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Interactive Game Grid: The Tic-Tac-Toe grid is created using HTML and can be interacted with by the user. Players can click on a cell to place their X or O.

Turn Indicator: A dynamic heading updates to indicate whether it's X's or O's turn, changing after each move to guide the players.

Game Reset Functionality: A dedicated button allows players to clear the grid and restart the game at any point.

Winning and Draw Announcements: Utilizes Bootstrap alerts to announce the winner or declare a draw when the board is full, making the end of each game clear and visually engaging.

Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in front-end development by implementing a well-known game using the tools and techniques learned during the bootcamp. This includes writing clean, maintainable HTML, styling with CSS, and adding interactive functionality with JavaScript.

This game serves as a testament to the skills I have acquired in my journey as a front-end developer and stands as a practical example of applying coding principles to create enjoyable web applications.

Coding Assignment
This project is a submission for a coding assignment from Promineo Tech, a part of a series of tasks designed to challenge and improve the coding abilities of bootcamp participants.
